# Trivia Game

A trivia-game for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp

## Functionality  

The trivia game is based on jQuery and manipulation of the DOM.

When the game starts, each question that appears on the screen is timed at 30 seconds, and questions must be answered within that duration. Scores are tallied accordingly as the user has answered.  
At the end of the game, the score is revealed to the player and the game is reset.  

The framework used for the project was Google's MaterializeCSS, which has been my first project using the framework.

## Problems

The code isn't ideal. Would like to rewrite and store function within larger objects.  

Many functions require hiding and deleting elements, would like to create a more efficient flow for the program.
